At Check, we have a workforce on the street that consists of **Swappers**, **Fixers** and **Mechanics**. These employees have scheduled shifts in which they perform specific tasks for our vehicles. **Swappers** replace the batteries of mopeds, **Fixers** do small fixes on mopeds and **Mechanics** do the bigger repairs.

We would like to know how many minutes it would take a group containing a **Swapper**, a **Fixer** and a **Mechanic** to finish a predetermined route.

You will be given two arrays of data:
1) The first array is a list of mopeds. Each moped consists of a string of characters: `S`, `F` or `M`. Each character represents a task that needs to be performed for that vehicle: `S` for swapping a battery, `F` for a small fix, `M` for a big repair.
2) The second array is a list of distances in minutes between the mopeds. So, `distance[0]` is the distance between `mopeds[0]` and `mopeds[1]`, `distance[1]` is the distance between `mopeds[1]` and `mopeds[2]`, and so on.

It's a given that a **swap** takes _1 minute_, a **small fix** takes _5 minutes_ and a **big repair** takes _8 minutes_. Each employee needs to follow the route in the given order. However, they don't always need to perform a task at every moped. An employee shouldn't continue his route if there are no tasks left for him to do.

Write a piece of code that takes the input below and determines how many minutes it would take a group containing a **Swapper**, a **Fixer** and a **Mechanic** to finish the given route.
